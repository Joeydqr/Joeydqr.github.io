      <h3>The Octane</h3>
      <p>a vehicle body released on July 7, 2015, along with the game release. It originally appeared in the Rocket
        League precursor Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. The Octane is classified as "Common" rarity.

        The Octane's taillights look like the Apollo N's taillights. The grill and headlights look like a Caterham 7's
        grill and head lights. The Octane has a mid engine layout.

        The Octane is one of the three bodies already unlocked at the beginning of the game, and is the default body
        selected when a player plays for the first time or creates a new preset in the garage.

        It has remained the most popular body in the game since Rocket League's release.[3][4] It is by far the most
        popular with high ranked players and the most used by champion players during the Rocket League Championship
        Series.[5][6]

        As of August 3, 2017, painted variants of Octane were made available via the trade-in system.[7] These variants
        are categorized as "Import" rarity. Unlike the default Octane, painted variants can be traded.</p>
